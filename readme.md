  # Project Notes

  This is a **short example** of Markdown. We use *italic* and `code` too.

  ## Tasks

  1. Review the design
  2. Update the docs
  3. Run tests

  ## Links and code

  See the [API docs](docs/api_example.md) for usage. Example:

  ```python
  def greet(name):
      print(f"Hello, {name}!")
  ```

  > Tip: Save as a .md file and open in a Markdown viewer to see the result.
